## Hello Everyone 👋🏽

I just learnt how to create a blog with Gatsby Js and I'm so excited to announce that I have decided to stop being lazy so, from today henceforth, I pledge to myself, that I will start write at least one article every two months (still seems like laziness but whatever lol).

I'll talk about a number of topics which will not limited to tech. I'll talk about tech, I'll talk about my achievements, My experiences, Life milestones, year in reviews, etc.

<!-- ```html
<div>Sorry, Just had to test the code feature on this editor</div>

Glad to have you here! I dunno, might spin up a newsletter thing soon so y'all can get new articles in your emails. Let's see how this goes!

See You around!
