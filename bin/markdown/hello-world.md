## Hello Everyone 👋🏽

I just re-learnt how to create a blog with Gatsby Js and I'm so excited to announce that I have decided to stop being lazy sooooo, on this day, 12th December, 2021, I pledge to myself that I will write at least one article every two months (still seems like laziness but rome wasn't built in a day lol).

I'll talk about a number of topics which will not limited to tech. I'll talk about tech, I'll talk about my achievements, experiences, milestones, life generally, year in reviews, etc.

<!-- ```html

Glad to have you here! I dunno, might spin up a newsletter thing soon so y'all can get new articles in your emails. Let's see how this goes!

See You around!
